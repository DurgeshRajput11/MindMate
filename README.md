## ‚ù§Ô∏è Project Motivation

Mental health remains a significant societal taboo in India. Young adults and students, facing intense academic and social pressures, often feel isolated with their concerns. The fear of judgment from family and peers, combined with the high cost and scarcity of professional help, creates a formidable barrier to seeking support.  

MindMate was born from the belief that **everyone deserves a safe space to be heard**. It aims to be the crucial first step in a user's wellness journey‚Äîa **confidential friend** that listens without judgment, available anytime, anywhere. By leveraging AI, we can offer a scalable, accessible, and private resource to help **destigmatize mental health conversations** and guide users toward the support they need.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a simple but secure workflow to manage conversations:

1. **User Input**: The user sends a message through the Streamlit chat interface.  
2. **Crisis Detection**: Before any AI processing, the message is scanned locally for high-risk keywords related to self-harm or suicide.  
3. **Safety First**: If a crisis is detected, the AI conversation is immediately halted, and a non-dismissible alert with Indian helpline numbers is displayed.  
4. **AI Interaction**: If the message is safe, it is sent along with the system prompt to the Hugging Face Inference API.  
5. **Empathetic Response**: The AI model generates a supportive, non-advisory response, which is then displayed back to the user in the chat interface.
